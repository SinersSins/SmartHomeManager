**1. User Authentication and Household Setup**

* 1.1 Registration
    * Step 1: User visits the registration page. 
    * Inputs name, email, password.
    * Submits the form.
    * Backend: Save user details in the database. Send confirmation (e.g., "Account successfully created").
    * Next Step: Redirect to login.
* 1.2 Login
    * Step 1: User inputs email and password.
    * On success: Redirect to the dashboard.
    * On failure: Show an error (e.g., "Incorrect email or password").
    * Backend: Generate a session token (or JWT) for authentication.
* 1.3 Household Setup
    * Step 1: User is prompted to set up their household:
        * Create rooms (e.g., Bedroom, Living Room) via a form.
        * Add device types to each room (e.g., Lamp, Fan, Thermostat).
    * Example: 
        * User selects "Add Room" → Inputs "Bedroom."
        * User selects "Add Device" → Chooses "Lamp" and "Fan."
    * Backend: Save household structure (user -> rooms -> devices) in the database.

**2. Appliance Control Dashboard**

* 2.1 Dashboard Overview
    * Step 1: User lands on a dashboard showing all rooms and devices.
    * Example Layout: 
        * Bedroom: Lamp (On), Fan (Off).
        * Living Room: TV (Off), Thermostat (22°C).
    * Step 2: User clicks a device to control it:
        * Lamp: Toggle on/off or adjust brightness.
        * Thermostat: Change temperature.
        * Fan: Adjust speed.
    * Backend: Send updates to the simulated device state and persist the changes.
* 2.2 Device States
    * Real-time updates to reflect device status changes.

**3. Routine Scheduling System**

* 3.1 Adding a Routine
    * Step 1: User navigates to the "Routines" tab and clicks "Create Routine."
    * Step 2: User defines the routine:
        * Select devices: (e.g., All Lights).
        * Specify actions: (e.g., Turn Off).
        * Set time: (e.g., 10:00 PM daily).
    * Backend: Save routine details in the database.
* 3.2 Routine Execution
    * Step 1: At the scheduled time, the system executes the routine.
    * Step 2: Update the dashboard to reflect the new device states.
    * Optional: Send a notification to the user ("All lights have been turned off.").

**4. Simulated Energy Usage Tracking**

* 4.1 View Energy Usage
    * Step 1: User navigates to the "Energy Usage" tab.
    * Step 2: User sees:
        * Total energy consumed by all devices.
        * Breakdown by room or device (e.g., AC = 30 kWh, Lamp = 5 kWh).
        * Visual reports (charts/graphs).
    * Backend: Use device uptime and power consumption rates to calculate dummy usage.

**5. Alerts for Device Malfunctions**

* 5.1 Real-Time Alerts
    * Step 1: User sees alerts in the notification panel (e.g., “Living Room Heater has been on for 24 hours!”).
    * Step 2: User clicks the alert to view details and suggested actions (e.g., Turn Off, Reset).
    * Backend: Continuously monitor device states for anomalies (uptime, temperature limits, etc.).
